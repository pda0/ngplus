# NGPlus
Free Pascal implementation of various modern Delphi classes and records.

  - Define ENABLE_UNICODE if you want to compile this units in DELPHIUNICODE mode.
  - Define CLOSER_TO_DELPHI if you want to get as close to Delphi behaviour as possible (array size limited to Integer, etc.). Note that modern Delphi uses Unicode strings, so for the maximum similarity you should also define ENABLE_UNICODE.
